Let's see how this goes

# 1 Google is your best friend!
Since I don't use Telegram, I decided to see if there was something out there for Whatsapp
Found this from GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/ishween/whatsapp-push-notify-action">ishween</a>

# 2 What is going on?
Looked through her repo files to make sense of things
Twilio is needed, so I signed up and looked up a few more articles, namely:
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/send-whatsapp-message-30-seconds-python">Send Whatsapp Message</a>
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/how-to-send-whatsapp-media-messages-with-python">How to Send Whatsapp Media Messages</a>

# 3 I can do this?
I figure instead of using her code, I can try to do it myself.
After 4 hours of failure, I am back to square 1, using her code.
And it works.
